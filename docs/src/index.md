## What is Chmy.jl?

[Chmy.jl](https://github.com/PTsolvers/Chmy.jl) (pronounce *tsh-mee*) is a **backend-agnostic toolkit for finite difference computations** on multi-dimensional computational staggered grids. Chmy.jl features **task-based distributed memory parallelisation capabilities** and provides a comprehensive **framework for handling complex computational tasks on structured grids**, leveraging both single and multi-device architectures. It seamlessly integrates with Julia's powerful parallel and concurrent programming capabilities, making it suitable for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications.

## How to Install Chmy.jl?

To install Chmy.jl, one can simply add it using the Julia package manager by running the following command in the Julia REPL:

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("Chmy")
```

After the package is installed, one can load the package by using:

```julia
julia> using Chmy
```

If you want to use the latest unreleased version of Chmy.jl, you can run the following command:

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/PTsolvers/Chmy.jl")
```
