# Grids

The choice of numerical grid used depends on the type of equations to be resolved and affects the discretization schemes used. The design of the `Chmy.Grids` module aims to provide a robust yet flexible user API in customizing the numerical grids used for spatial discretization.

We currently support grids with quadrilateral cells. An `N`-dimensional numerical grid contains N spatial dimensions, each represented by an axis.

| Grid Properties | Description |Tunable Parameters |
|:-------|:------------|:------------|
| Dimensions | The grid can be N-dimensional by having N axes. | `AbstractAxis` |
| Distribution of Nodal Points | The grid can be regular (uniform distribution) or non-regular (irregular distribution). | `UniformAxis`, `FunctionAxis` |
| Distribution of Variables | The grid can be non-staggered (collocated) or staggered, affecting how variables are positioned within the grid. | `Center`, `Vertex` |

## Axis

Objects of type `AbstractAxis` are building blocks of numerical grids. We can either define equidistant axes with `UniformAxis`, or parameterized axes with `FunctionAxis`.

### Uniform Axis

To define a uniform axis, we need to provide:

- `Origin`: The starting point of the axis.
- `Extent`: The length of the section of the axis considered.
- `Cell Length`: The length of each cell along the axis.

With the information above, an axis can be defined and incorporated into a spatial dimension. The `spacing` (with alias `Δ`) and `inv_spacing` (with alias `iΔ`) functions allow convenient access to the grid spacing (`Δx`/`Δy`/`Δz`) and its reciprocal, respectively.

### Function Axis

As an alternative, one could also define a `FunctionAxis` object using a function that parameterizes the spacing of the axis, together with the length of the axis.

```julia
f = i -> ((i - 1) / 4)^1.5
length = 4
parameterized_axis = FunctionAxis(f, length)
```

## Structured Grids

A common mesh structure that is used for the spatial discretization in the finite difference approach is a structured grid (concrete type `StructuredGrid` or its alias `SG`).

We provide a function `UniformGrid` for creating an equidistant `StructuredGrid`, that essentially boils down to having axes of type `UniformAxis` in each spatial dimension.

```julia
# with architecture as well as numerics lx/y/z and nx/y/z defined
grid   = UniformGrid(arch;
                    origin=(-lx/2, -ly/2, -lz/2),
                    extent=(lx, ly, lz),
                    dims=(nx, ny, nz))
```

!!! warning "Metal backend"
    If using the Metal backend, ensure to use `Float32` (`f0`) element types in the `origin` and `extent` tuples when initialising the grid.

## Location on a Grid Cell

In order to allow full control over the distribution of different variables on the grid, we provide a high-level abstraction of the property location on a grid cell with the abstract type `Location`. More concretely, a property location along a spatial dimension can be either of concrete type `Center` or `Vertex` on a structured grid.

We illustrate how to specify the location within a grid cell on a fully staggered uniform grid. The following 2D example also has ghost nodes illustrated that are located immediately outside the domain boundary.

```@raw html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PTsolvers/Chmy.jl/main/docs/src/assets/staggered_grid.png" width="80%"/>
```

In the following example, we zoom into a specific cell on a **fully-staggered grid**. By specifying for both x- and y-dimensions whether the node locates at the `Center` (C) or `Vertex` (V) along the respective axis, we can arrive in 4 categories of nodes on a 2D quadrilateral cell, which we refer to as "basic", "pressure", "Vx" and "Vy" nodes, following common practices.

```@raw html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PTsolvers/Chmy.jl/main/docs/src/assets/staggered_grid_cell.png" width="50%"/>
```

If all variables are defined on basic nodes, specified by `(V,V)` locations, we have the simplest non-staggered **collocated grid**.

## Dimensions of Fields on Structured Grids

With a structured grid defined that consists of `nx = N` cells horizontally and `ny = M` cells vertically, we have the following dimensions for fields associated with the grid.

| Node Type | Field Dimension | Location |
|:----------|:----------------|:---------|
| Cell vertex | $(N + 1) \times (M + 1)$ | `(V, V)` |
| X interface | $(N + 1) \times M$       | `(V, C)` |
| Y interface | $ N \times (M + 1)$      | `(C, V)` |
| Cell Center | $N \times M$             | `(C, C)` |

## Connectivity of a `StructuredGrid`

Using the method `connectivity(::SG{N,T,C}, ::Dim{D}, ::Side{S})`, one can obtain the connectivity underlying a structured grid. If no special grid topology is provided, a default `Bounded` grid topology is used for the `UniformGrid`. Therefore, on a default `UniformGrid`, the following assertions hold:

```julia-repl
julia> @assert connectivity(grid, Dim(1), Side(1)) isa Bounded "Left boundary is bounded"

julia> @assert connectivity(grid, Dim(1), Side(2)) isa Bounded "Right boundary is bounded"

julia> @assert connectivity(grid, Dim(2), Side(1)) isa Bounded "Upper boundary is bounded"

julia> @assert connectivity(grid, Dim(2), Side(2)) isa Bounded "Lower boundary is bounded"
```
